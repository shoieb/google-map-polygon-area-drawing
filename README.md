A sample project to draw polygon area on google map. Currently the maximum limit to create areas is set to 3.
The initial view contains two buttons and a map container.

Also you can click on the top Add button to add more areas.
You can also click on the area to select it to update or click the top Remove button to remove it. After updating an area the calculations will automatically get updated.
On the bottom of the map the total of all areas is shown.
